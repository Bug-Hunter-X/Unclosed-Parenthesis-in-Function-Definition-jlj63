This repository demonstrates a common Python error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in a `SyntaxError`. The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected code.  The error is subtle and can be easily missed, especially in larger codebases. Understanding how to identify and resolve such errors is crucial for effective Python programming.
